* Merging and changes

** review of changes

I have not looked at the code for a while. since then we had some notable
changes. Two new kaveh-devel-X branches have appeared and we have some demos to
investigate. I will concentrate on branch kaveh-devel-3 to review the changes.

My jacek-devel branch was merged with kaveh-devel-3 and I can see 100 files
changes since commit 0be7048. That includes a font and libraries dealing with
fonts.

** continued
I will look at running the new code ater the merger.
Let's see if [[file:~/Programming/Lisp/kons-9-notes/notes.org::*first run][first run]] is any useful.
