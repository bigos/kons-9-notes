* Trying main demos
Following my lack of success described in:
file:~/Programming/Lisp/kons-9-notes/brainstorming/merging-and-changes.org::64

I had response from the author
https://github.com/kaveh808/kons-9/discussions/158#discussioncomment-3997035
which I am going to try.

** Latest main code
I am at my fork of main branch. I start slime. And see the Readme file.
file:~/Programming/Lisp/kons-9/README.md::41

I disagree with this code
file:~/Programming/Lisp/kons-9/README.md::47

#+begin_src lisp
(push (uiop:getcwd) ql:*local-project-directories*)
+end_src

because on my system it sends me down the wrong path.
#+begin_example
(uiop:getcwd)
#P"/home/jacek/Programming/Lisp/kons-9-notes/brainstorming/"
#+end_example

I prefer my version
file:~/Programming/Lisp/kons-9-notes/notes.org::21
where I explicitly state the correct path for my system.
