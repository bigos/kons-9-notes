* Linux
** I. Prerequisites

This document was written on latest Linux Mint. I have compiled SBCL and Emacs
from source so I have most of the development libraries already installed.

Also I had git installed and configured.

*** Missing library
In your terminal on Ubuntu based Linux run the following:
#+begin_example
sudo apt install libglfw3-dev
#+end_example
y
On a different Linux distro the command and the library name may be different.

** II. Installation and configuration

*** Pull the code from Github
#+begin_example
cd ~/Programming/Lisp
git clone https://github.com/kaveh808/kons-9.git
cd ./kons-9
#+end_example

*** first run
Use REPL to load the code.

#+begin_example
(push #p "~/Programming/Lisp/kons-9/" ql:*local-project-directories*)
(ql:quickload "kons-9")
(in-package :kons-9)
#+end_example

And run the code
#+begin_example
(run)
#+end_example

** III. Smoke test

*** Run the demos
#+begin_example
(load "~/Programming/Lisp/kons-9/test/test-demos.lisp")
#+end_example

** IV. Contacts and avenues of help

For the time being please raise an issue in this repo asking for help and
detailing your problem.
